                <h3>Where did they come from?</h3>
                <p>In the late 1980s, computer viruses came about because of several factors. The first factor was the spread of personal computers (PCs), which were becoming a more common in households. Withe the releases of the IBM PC and Apple Machintosh, by the late 1980s, PCs were common in businesses, homes and college campuses.
                </p>
                <p>The second factor was the use of online computer bulletin boards where peopel could download programs of all types. Games, word processors, spreadsheets, and other productivity software were extremely popular. Bulletin boards led to the virus known as the Trojan horse, which would masquerade as a program, but when you run the program, it would erase your hard drive. Trojan horses only hit a small number of people because they're quickly discovered, and word of the danger spreads among users.</p>
                <p>The third factor that led to the creation of viruses was the floppy disk. In the 1980s, programs were small, and you could fit the entire operating system, a few programs and some documents onto a floppy disk or two. Many computers did not have hard disks, so when you turned on your machine it would load the operating system and everything else from the floppy disk. Virus authors took advantage of this to create the first self-replicating programs and infect the computer.</p>
